An 90's clone built without any online help back in 1999.

It's got 32bit Windows XP executables - which would need DOS Box in order run.

Because it was designed without any help, it contains lots of mistakes and really bad design choices. But it was the first game I ever wrote, so I've put it onlne to keep it for memories sake.
I also never worked out how to do slopes integrated into the block-style level designer.
These days it's all online! I wonder what I could have achieved knowing this lot? ... http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br5NfeQsLQo , though there's thousands of links.

There's even a little level editor in it:
